# Audio Bit-shifter
A command-line tool for bit shifting audio.

I made this on a whim after a guy on the 8-Bit Music Theory Discord server mentioned he was curious. It took me about one night's worth of work, but I tried to make it easy to use (meaning you can run it with just a double click, but also it should be fairly self-explanatory how to use it).

Unfortunately, my inexperience shows in this tool's platform reach: I only have a build for Windows x86_64. I'd like to figure out how to compile it for web, but I don't think I could get a working interface for it in one night. Heck, with my experience, I'd be lucky to do it in a week.
